# Unseen Hunger
### The silent crisis of food insecurity among college students ([Website](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/unseen-hunger/index.html))

On the journey to creating a cohesive narrative exploring food insecurity among college students, I incorporated some of the feedback from part 2. The target audience was reflected in the interviews as students in college struggling with food insecurity as well as school administrators to understand the gravity of the issue to better repurpose food resources on campus. Both the calls to action addressed how to get involved as a student, where to donate, and how to get help as a student. The most important consideration taken from the interviews with current and past students is that the process of explaining the narrative starting with oversupply needed more context to better set up. Some of the components needed to be reorganized and some new elements were added to allow readers to follow along with the story arc more effectively. The new story arc included summaries for each section that indicated when the narrative shifted from plenty to scarcity of food and when it shifted from a general view nationally to just among college students in the US. These banners helped to focus the story and split the context.

Another improvement incorporated was to simplify the graphics that confused such as the plots exploring the gender and racial disparities in food insecurity. The plot on multiple occasions in both peer reviews and user research was confused so the plot was simplified to match the remaining theme of the website.

Other improvements were made to the website to include more consistency among terminology so terminology such as food scarcity and lack of food was changed to food insecurity. Below is the website.
